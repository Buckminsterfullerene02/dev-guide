# What is this?
When I first started talking to game developers about modding in Unreal Engine, I realised that there are both misconceptions and a complete lack of knowledge of the field. My goal is to inform both developers and modders of all the possibilities that modding can offer. Only known and used methods will be covered, which means that I will not explore potential options that don’t exist yet, such as ones covered in [this post](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/modding-data-driven-thoughts-how-to-best-accomplish/65495).

If you are reading this with a bad perception of modding already, I encourage that you keep an open mind and read at least the overview section before the deep dive into everything there is to know. If you know that you want to add mod support, great! Feel free to skip the overview section and go straight on to the good stuff.
