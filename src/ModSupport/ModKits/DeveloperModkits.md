# Developer Modkits

There is a certain way to produce a modkit that trumps every other way and is extremely powerful for modding, while **not** exposing the source code of the game.

This is an idea that is very obvious in hindsight, yet is something not many games have done before. I really hope that more games in the future will do this!

## Extra credit

I know I've already mentioned [Archengius](https://github.com/Archengius/) in the home page's credits, but I really feel obliged to mention him again here. Most of the information in the [How?](./DeveloperModkits/How.md) section is from his own research and experience, that he has obtained from:
- Working on the critical tools and community modkit for Satisfactory, then getting hired by Coffee Stain Studios
- Working on the official modkit for Satisfactory (currently unreleased)

This is why much of the information here is not information you can just find in the documentation - a lot of work by him and myself has been delving into engine code to figure things out ourselves.

As always, if you have read through this section and are serious about making a modkit for your game, and wish to know more information in more detail, I recommend that you contact him on Discord. You can do that by either joining the Satisfactory Modding or the official Satisfactory Discords and DMing him from there.
