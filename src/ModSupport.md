# Mod Support
Based on what has been discussed, there are 5 major tiers for mod support, in order of increasing difficulty:
1.	Natively mounting mods during game initialisation
2.	A mod management system
3.	Release an SDK/mod kit, document, or information on internal systems to aid modders create more high-quality mods faster
4.	Providing a scripting API
5.	Enable plugin modding by changing the game build type to modular

Since I’ve already covered tiers 4 and 5 earlier, I will now cover tiers 1 – 3 in more detail.
